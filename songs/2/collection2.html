            this was supposed fit the theme of a detective working in the shadows, and i think i captured that pretty well.
            <br /> <br />
            trivia:
            <br /> <br />
            the title, "Mister X" comes from the game "Scotland Yard" where one player is "Mr. X" or "Ms. X" and the other players have to catch them.
            It's a really fun game, so if you have a friend group, i would recommend giving it a try.

            chill piece i made during winter break off of school. I tried to fuse a ton of independent instruments from garageband into one track, which sounds pretty questionable.
            (erhu, koto, guzheng, 808 bass, 808 flex, and the chord synths which i can't remember the name of)
            <br /> <br />
            the counting sample was recorded by me, of myself whispering.
            <br /> <br />
            the microwave sample was recorded by me, of my microwave macaroni and cheese.

            attempt at a techno-style piece. The instrumentation in this one is really weird, from using flutes and piano to guitar and bassoon. I kind of like how it turned out, but you can judge for yourself.

            This is a track i made, inspired by littlebigplanet's gradually building music.
            It sounds kinda cacophonous towards the end, but it can be looped in other areas.
            I personally don't really like this track, but it's a different style than what i usually do.

            this was the seventh entry in a series of "drum experiments" i did which I decided to make into a full song.
            The main loop in this is from garageband, called "Lost In Thought Piano 02" in the keyboard collection sound pack. The rest is made by me.
            I mostly worked on this at lunch at school

            sequel to sword, which i don't like very much because of the fact that this was somewhat rushed
