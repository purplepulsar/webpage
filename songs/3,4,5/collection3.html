                This is a background track i made for a documentary for my science class, about the history and effects of climate change.
                <br />
                It does use four samples, from an old sample cd called "Zero-G Datafile 1" and "Zero-G Datafile 2".
                One of them is a drumloop at the end, one of them is a record scratch, and another one is a sample of a fax machine, i think? I'm not quite sure.
                <br /> <br />
                the snare drum at the beginning (Roland TR-909) is from a youtuber called "Bouncy Glow's Music Room" from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KenvUibY7uc
                (update: it comes from a synthesizer called the Korg T3.) 
                <br /> <br />
                also, the weird title is an anagram for "time never comes back"

                second piece i made for the documentary in science class. I had to mute this a ton in the actual video because of how little it is "background music". 
                <br /> <br />
                Samples used
                <br />
                chord from "X-Static Goldmine 1"
                <br />
                choir from "Zero-G Datafile 2"
                <br />
                record scratch from “Zero-G Datafile 1”
                <br />
                cymbal at the end from sonic cd past pcm channel
                <br /><br />
                the old title was an anagram for something, but i didn't write down what it was :(

                song i made in the style of sonic r / sonic cd. all instruments used were stock garageband except for the bass, which was a combination of an organ from a synthesizer and one from garageband.
                <br /> <br />
                electric cell zone comes from the jumpiness of the song

                act 2 of electric cell zone. the analog chords near the second part are from an app called "animoog".
                <br />
                the sound effect as a transition was a pitched down cymbal overlayed with a bubble wrap pop sound.

                something i made after playing the board game settlers of catan with my family.
                <br />
                this is a soundtrack-ish long piece attempting to combine many different feels together, with an overall theme of wilderness.
                <br />
                the part at the very end was a test for a different piece, which i will upload in the future.

            this song is called help 4 because it's the fourth revision of a song i came up with in the middle of the night, hence the name "help".
            <br />
            the original version had an phaser effect over the whole thing, but i didn't really like it so i removed it.
            <br />
            the guitar playing one note throughout the whole song is inspired by "Voyager" by Daft Punk.
            <br /><br />
            the four samples (at the beginning, and through the song) are from a song "Wake Me, Shake Me" on a cd called "harmony road toddler tunes" from a music class "harmony road" when i was three years old or so.
