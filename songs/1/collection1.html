            idk what this was really, it turned out pretty cool
            <br />
            since i made this in garageband on my ipad, and didn't know what automation was yet, the cymbal fade in at the beginning was done solely with velocity changes lol

            i then got scouted and then spammed the audio portal with everything i had made

            third entry in the bounce series. changed up the drums a bit. this one is a little bit cluttered though
            <br />
            <br />
            trivia time: red mushroom is a reference to the fact that in mariokart wii, red mushrooms make you bounce.

            fourth and presumably final entry in the "bounce" series.
            It was originally going to be my last song, because my parents were restricting my access to my ipad (which i use for music production).
            Well, that obviously got sorted out and i kept making music.
            However, unless i feel like i want to, i will probably not make music in this instrumentation/style for a while (i also ran out of catchy leitmotifs for these pieces).
            <br />
            <br />
            trivia:
            the choppy voice samples (recorded by me, of course, otherwise i couldn't upload this to newgrounds) were (clearly) inspired by "Brain Power" by NOMA.
            the garbled voice at the beginning (also my voice, put through the robot filter in garageband) says a bunch of things i can't remember, one of them being "adhd" (which i have) and another being "paradox" which i don't really know why i put in.
